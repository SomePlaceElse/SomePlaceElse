"@nielsie15 probably will be the best game of this year's playoffs, b/c the field is so mediocre this year mostly due to injuries"
"@nielsie15 CP3 also made a great game winner vs Spurs with 1 second left that wasn't a buzzer beater"

"@IanCharles33 @jordanw1096 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley true but the Clippers starting lineup prob wouldve murdered POR in the first quarter"
"@IanCharles33 @jordanw1096 @NotTheFakeJM24  given POR's injuries, NOP was deeper, has arguably the best NBA player &amp; better shooters"

"@IanCharles33 @jordanw1096 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley I agree"
"@IanCharles33 @jordanw1096 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley if they can at least keep MEM from scoring a lot they should grind out 4 wins"
"@IanCharles33 @jordanw1096 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley probably. GS has a lot more talent but MEM poses some tough matchups"
"@IanCharles33 @jordanw1096 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley MJ was a threat in the low post. U couldn't just push him around"
"@IanCharles33 @jordanw1096 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley not the Cavs &amp; probably not the Bulls if healthy IMO"

"@IanCharles33 @jordanw1096 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley Lebron just had his worst season in 10 years and is shooting 42% in the playoffs"
"@IanCharles33 @jordanw1096 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley keep in mind that Lebron is past his prime. Not nearly as good as 5 years ago"
"@IanCharles33 @jordanw1096 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley and at full health they're anyway much better then CLE."
"@IanCharles33 @jordanw1096 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley not really b/c they got the chemistry. Cavs had no team chemistry either"
"@auchamps4life @talkhoops @XMD42 bad matchup. I guess they weren't as good as a typical 67-win team but they were much better then ATL now"
"@auchamps4life @thashark316 @The_Reliant @XMD42 it was a shorter series &amp; upsets happen, but SEA was no doubt a better team then ATL now"
"@jordanw1096 @IanCharles33 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley agreed. Would've probably lost in 6"
"@IanCharles33 @jordanw1096 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley he's pretty good but not that great"

"@jordanw1096 @IanCharles33 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley on every position offensively and defensively to an insane degree"
"@jordanw1096 @IanCharles33 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley OKC period IMO. I doubt that GS would be able to keep up this level. OKC is loaded"
"@jordanw1096 @IanCharles33 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley when the Cavs big three played together, they had an insane plus-minus together"
"@jordanw1096 @IanCharles33 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley a healthy Cavs team is arguably the most unstoppable on offense"
"@IanCharles33 @jordanw1096 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley disagree. Bogut is an elite rim protector on his own"
"@IanCharles33 @jordanw1096 @NotTheFakeJM24 @JoshEberley I know that. Very solid defense in the frontcourt and on the perimeter"

"@auchamps4life @talkhoops @XMD42 the Mavs were swept by GS in that reg season. Obviously GS's small lineup was bad matchup for them"

"@LukersT @Jonathan_Feigen so u really believe he thinks so? What coach doesn't make adjustments? That's what you're a coach for"
"@pelucachick46 I agree but since Lebron is on the Cavs that's different"

"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 yeah that's what it looks like"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I never thought about it. Somehow he's been good enough on both ends"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 hmm never even realized that or thought about it"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 that in turn increased Harden's effectiveness b/c defenders have to respect Terry"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 yeah but Harden needs a good 3pt shooter to throw the ball to when double teamed"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 yeah very good on both ends of court, and rebounds well"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 yeah but Terry is far better 3pt shooter"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I would destroy Reggie in a 3pt shoutout... Plus he's a ball hog &amp; bad fit with Harden"
"@mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 pretty sure MIA didn't give up 2 first rounders on a rental"
"@mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 I think he'd be good fit but I think it's a 80% chance he stays with MIA"

"@mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 ball hog. He &amp; Harden might trade punches"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I agree. It's a little tough to imagine them going to HOU"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 hmm don't know"
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 besides Dragic none of them are a fit with Harden"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 true. Offensively he's below average, and HOU knows it, so they prob won't pay him"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 not sure b/c I think they need a PG who can shoot more then a passer b/c they got Harden"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I can promise u that if Morey can get his hands on Aldridge or Love he will jump on them"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 what aspect?"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 some other team no doubt will pay a lot more though"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 probably. Morey has proven he can get it done 50% of the time"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 if HOU pays him he'll stay. It's more likely that HOU will let him go though IMO"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I mean in HOU he never had to run the show b/c of Harden. He might get exposed elsewhere"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I can't predict that"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 till Jones decides to be a star. They want an elite PF in 2016, not 2021"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I agree. He wants to keep him off the bench. But HOU is a win now team and won't wait"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 agree. At this point it's inevitable. He has huge wingspan &amp; is a shot blocking machine"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 doubt it"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 won't get the max but might get a deal close to what Ariza got last year"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 true but he'll try to cash in on his defensive reputation, &amp; some ass team will overpay"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 he wants a big payday more then he wants to start. But it goes hand in hand really"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 the NBA is a business, especially in your first free agency. It applies to everybody"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 When Morey hunted Bosh &amp; other PFs it's b/c he recognized that Jones isn't good enough"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 got this reputation from"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 do u think Howard decides in crunch time to hit free throws? I don't know where y'all"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 should've won DPOY if played and started more games. He's a defensive monster"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 chemistry my ass it's all about $$$ bruh"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 he's gonna wants big $$$ not sure if HOU will wanna give it to him"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I doubt he wants that. And he wants $$$ first and foremost"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I know but who says HOU will wanna spend $$$ on him if he asks for big payday?"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 had a few bad FT games lately but overall he's a lot better"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 he's improved in recent seasons"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 only HOU fans really believe Jones will be a star. Daryl Morey clearly doesn't think so"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 he earned back respect around NBA. He showed that he can be great in lesser role"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 he'll definitely leave. Somebody is giving him a good contract this offseason."
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I know but when did that 20 rebound game happen?"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 why do u think he staying?"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 true he's been great for stretches but not as consistent as in the past"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 no why would I want that? They can keep Jones &amp; bring him off the bench"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 Cousins can score from 18 feet too. And once in the low post he's almost unstoppable"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 39 rebounds? When did that happen?"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 Jones is a good defender against average PFs, but is too small to guard the big ones"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 nah he clearly lacks the burst and the same athleticism he had"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 yeah I kinda agree with that. He's taller so maybe can annoy but not a great defender"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 I agree. I said all along HOU needs an elite PF and at least a good PG to win a title"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 absolutely. I now think he's better then Gasol but not nearly as good as Cousins now"
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 what idiot coach plays Harden with 2 minutes left down 26?"
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 da real MVP lol"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 I acknowledged he's still great, but like LeBron he lost a step"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 u don't see the 35 &amp; 20 games anymore like u saw in playoffs in Orlando"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 he's just tall. Maybe would've given harder time but wouldn't have stopped the bleeding"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 I agree. But an injured CP3 effectively eliminates their small chance for an upset"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 he's aight but will never be a star"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 True but Howard can at least help defend. Also Love will give u more offense &amp; outscore"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 PG is not as important as most ppl think cuz Harden is an elite playmaker. But still"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 u need someone else who can rebound &amp; dominate in low post. Preferably defend."
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 he's good but can't dominate to nearly the same level. Just like what happened with Bron"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 he was till this year. Now it's Cousins. Howard is clearly not superman anymore"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 he may have beat SA but he basically got KO'd of championship contention in the process"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 I agree he doesn't look good"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 and therefore they need a better supporting cast. A player like Kevin Love will help"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 u can't win a chip with that PG &amp; PF. Harden is not Duncan and Howard is past his prime"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 but u don't! That's what I'm saying. HOU is not good enough cuz they're missing pieces"
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 exactly. The rest helps him immensely. And playing 23 minutes got him back in shape"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 not if CP3 gets healthier (a big if). Unless the Clippers just don't show up"
"@mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 if CP3 gets healthier this is not going 6. But he isn't so who knows?"
"@mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 I have that app"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 yeah even though HOU didn't game plan for him u still can't allow this to happen"
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 like really y'all? http://t.co/H14ctG1Sv1"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 to just explode like that"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 obviously HOU typically will live with Rivers making shots, but u still can't allow him"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 @mikexcanxjerk u still have to defend. But HOU is getting exposed yet again. They're not that good"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 @mikexcanxjerk defend? I mean even a scrub in the NBA is still better then a very good college player"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 @mikexcanxjerk defend? I mean even a scrub in the NBA is still better then a very good college player"
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 this shit hurts. They're getting destroyed by Austin fucking Rivers"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 true but his father took him for a reason. Knows he sucks but tries to save his career"
"@BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 game not series"
"@TheRealZach3 @BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 kinda like Tebow. Comes up clutch when it matters but he sucks"
"@TheRealZach3 @BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 I don't think so. He had 2 great games. He might be clutch but he's not a good player"
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @TheRealZach3 kinda. It's a little weird"
"@jordanw1096 @mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 told y'all in the Mavs series that HOU's \"top-10\" D was suspect at best"
"@BSarow10 @mikexcanxjerk @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I don't think he'll be out of the league. Doc will keep him if he feels this will happen"
"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 he's still a bust but it's impressive how he's shown up in big moments, like G4 vs Spurs"
"@robinlundberg @Adi1839 come on Robin we all know that Lebron is feasting on a pathetic east in the last 5 years, &amp; Rose injuries helped"
"@RealSkipBayless not to mention that Irving sucked too... The man went 0-9 from 2 point range for crying out loud"
"@RealSkipBayless there was no luck. Lebron sucked in this game and just got so many calls. The shot wasn't lucky. It was a very nice three"
"@IanCharles33 true but u can't score only on layups. If u are a PG &amp; don't have an elite jumper there's no way u have a 50% FG%"

"@IanCharles33 yeah I agree. He was statistically a below average player (at best) despite scoring a lot"
"@IanCharles33 I doubt it. CP3 is one of the most efficient players in NBA history but is past his prime. Wall doesn't have a great jump shot"
"@IanCharles33 after all, the AS game is meant to make the league $$, so they wanna display the most popular stars w/o regard for performance"
"@IanCharles33 I get the fan voting system though b/c let's be real: Kobe is more popular to watch (&amp; drives more NBA revenue) then even CP3"
"@IanCharles33 it's what makes the all star a joke. Kinda like what Dalton being an all star does for the NFL (although was due to injuries)"
"@IanCharles33 its bs though. Kobe was great but doesn't deserve all star consideration right now over all these talented West guards"
"@IanCharles33 probably not. It's very hard for a lean PG (or any PG, really) to average 50% for a season."
"@IanCharles33 true. That MVP he actually won was more of a compensation for the MVP he perhaps should've won in 2006"
"@IanCharles33 Curry was never an all time great passer whatsoever... And Nash was a great shooter (not like Curry, but still)"
"@IanCharles33 you can also make an argument between Nash &amp; Kobe that one of them deserved the MVP that went ultimately to Dirk in 2007"
"@IanCharles33 that's a different convo though. Whether or not he deserved them he was still an all time great point guard"
"@IanCharles33 No... Nobody (who knows NBA history) mentions Curry in that convo. He's not (yet) in Nash's league"
"@IanCharles33 obviously Lakers fans won't be enamored when they hear his name mentioned, but who judges a player on his 40y/o performances?"
"@IanCharles33 not necessarily. They still call the kids who make the most beautiful out of nowhere passes \"Steve Nash\". He's a legend"
"@IanCharles33 he was one of the greatest passers ever"

"@The_Shield_ Tom Brady is not only a cheater, but a liar and an idiot (for trying to deny the obvious). And you're very biased."
"@IanCharles33 @BSarow10 \"wasn't even good yet\" is an overstatement. The Heat were far better then DAL that year they just choked it away"
"@BSarow10 ANA has home ice but Blackhawks are no doubt favorites for that series. Vegas has them now as a solid favorite to win the cup"
"@BSarow10 CHI actually was slightly better then LAK last year IMO. Their goalie was just not at his best in that series"
"@BSarow10 Kings were much more talented then the Ducks... And many games were close last year. They were two championship teams"
"@BSarow10 yeah, but unlike last year, it's not really evenly matched between two great teams. CHI is a great team, ANA is not nearly as good"
"@BSarow10 why? I don't think so at all. I doubt it can be as epic as last year's"
"@ejraider I didn't mean that he had no drives. I meant that he had nothing close to 18. He was settling too much on jumpers"

"@mikexcanxjerk @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I'd stick with Mchale for now. Jackson isn't enough of an upgrade to justify a shakeup"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 No. A team like Atlanta is a fraud. A team like Houston is actually very good, just missing some pieces"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 HOU is not a fraud. They're a very good team. But they're not a title contender, just a pretender"
"@IanCharles33 true"
"@IanCharles33 yeah that's true. I was referring to your Bogut suggestion"
"@IanCharles33 the game simply lacked the athleticism, star power and dunks we love to see. Too many mediocre players were there"
"@IanCharles33 not really. It was an underwhelming AS game but not b/c of Westbrook"
"@IanCharles33 Cousins is better but his team record has to be taken into consideration a little bit"
"@IanCharles33 that's a little hyperbole (I've seen weirder stat lines from Lebron, Davis, Durant, Kobe, Duncan, Dwight etc.) but yeah"
"@IanCharles33 five bucks is too cheap but the Larry O'Brian is clearly not high on his priorities"
"@IanCharles33 he's a businessman who plays basketball as a living"
"@IanCharles33 and anyway Kerr only decided the rotation, not the roster. That was up to the fans and coaches"
"@IanCharles33 maybe... But u can't realistically do that"
"@IanCharles33 yeah all star game is usually dominated by backcourt ball hogs. Westbrook really wanted that AS MVP trophy"
"@IanCharles33 then it's either Durant or Tim over Gasol"
"@IanCharles33 nah Marc Gasol is far better &amp; more consistent overall, especially with Z-Bo having lost a step"
"@IanCharles33 he is a very good inside-outside scorer though. He's overrated but he's pretty good"
"@IanCharles33 and he's not even THAT efficient, doesn't pass the ball, and makes his teammates worse. That's the antithesis to a good player"
"@IanCharles33 yeah he's a 3 I just had to mention him b/c I think he's arguably the most overrated player in the NBA"
"@IanCharles33 Bogut didn't deserve all star consideration over any of the other guys..."
"@IanCharles33 Cousins probably but I wouldn't really have started him b/c of how bad his team was. Maybe Aldridge, Durant or Tim"
"@IanCharles33 maybe, but when your team starts out 21-4 and you're the best player on your team u deserve a lot of credit &amp; appreciation"
"@IanCharles33 Kevin Love didn't make the all star (although he should have in that weak field), but he deserves an honorary mention too"
"@IanCharles33 true. Carmelo Anthony deserves a mention too (he plays the 4 often, and just sucks on defense &amp; is just so overrated)"
"@IanCharles33 but if given a redo I probably start someone else in the all star game over him..."
"@IanCharles33 true but he does numerous things that don't show on the stat sheet. I don't think he's that overrated"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @NOTNBATonight @TheRealZach3 arguably"
"@IanCharles33 b/c he's their only frontcourt defender. Even I can probably score on Griffin (maybe not, but u know what I mean)"
"@IanCharles33 in the beginning of the season I thought Marc Gasol might be the best C, but at this point it's Cousins in a landslide"
"@IanCharles33 @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 it's ok just relax"
"@IanCharles33  of course he has the highest FG% in the league. He only attempts dunks and putbacks"
"@IanCharles33 he can't score like him please. He's only a threat within 5 feet"
"@IanCharles33 not true. He'll never be close to Demarcus Cousins"
"@IanCharles33 @BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I wasn't referring to hack a shaq. I was referring to regular soft fouls on minor contact"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I think they hacked Howard 5 times &amp; smith twice. Doesn't compute to 64 free throws"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 the fouls on Howard were legit b/c he's an unstoppable force, but the fouls on the small guys were soft"
"@IanCharles33 I feel sorry for him in a way. He's forced into a high pressure situation he doesn't belong in"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 and the total team free throw attempts were 64!!! That's a ridiculous number"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 they hacked Howard only 5 times"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 wanna watch players making uncontested 15 footers. I wanna see them make 3s &amp; tough contested shots"

"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 For some reason watching the Rox, Clippers &amp; Cavs is awful. It always involves free throws after misses"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I can't blame him for complaining b/c he really has a point. It's not like he didn't play hard"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I'm not a Clipper though. As an onlooker it just looks awful &amp; against the spirit of the game"
"Austin Rivers crosses himself over again when if matters most lol http://t.co/JWeBin87MT\""

"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 I'm pretty sure his contact on JC was better then this \"charge\" that should've been a blocking foul"
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 a 64 to 32 free throw disparity in a game that went down to the wire made no diff? Are u kidding me?"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 ok but so what?"
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 and let this sink in too. Numerous fouls were similar to this https://t.co/4lcH4cRUNc"
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3  64 fucking free throws. Let that sink in for a moment"
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 and it's not true. Less then a third were intentional."
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 only half of the fouls on Howard were intentional"
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 it all depends on one CP3 IMO. But we'll see"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 the Rockets didn't defend, turned it over &amp; fouled on fast breaks. That's not a \"favorable call\""
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 they didn't get 64 foul shots and didn't even get many unjustified favorable calls at all"
"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 they fouled 32 times on purpose? 27 intentional free throws to Harden, Ariza &amp; Terry?"
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 nah not consistently or reliably whatsoever"
"@IanCharles33 @mikexcanxjerk een if it's 45 that's ridiculous. Just think about it it makes zero sense"

"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 the Clips have nobody who can make or create a shot in tight 4th quarters"

"@BSarow10 @jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 they didn't by comparison. Lol they were doubled up in foul shots"

"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 LAC still won b/c HOU is overrated but still"
"@jordanw1096 @BSarow10 @TheRealZach3 can't win w/o CP3. This game was proof. Game 1 was a fluke like I told y'all"

"@jordanw1096 @TheRealZach3 @BSarow10 ok but gotta take into consideration that Griffin was the only weapon. Everybody else sucked throughout"
